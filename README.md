BridgET is a toolbox intended to facilitate comparing and scaling evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from different measurements. At the moment it contains functions for sap flow and eddy covariance measurements. Functions for lysimeters and other measurement techniques will follow. The toolbox is in a very rough development state at the moment but will be continued.
