"""
The `footprint` submodule implements common methods to calculate the
footprint of the measurement from Eddy Covariance data.

Beside several methods that can calculate the timevariat footprint,
an aggregation method for defining a common footprint region is
given.

Examples
--------

    More to come soon

    Top-level footprint function.

    If more than one footprint method is implemented, these should go
    into functions in this module. This function then has a **string**
    parameter to switch the method.

    Parameters:
        - height = measurement height (z) [m]
        - wndspeed = horizontal wind component for the direction in which the sonic is oriented (u) [m/s]
        - cov_uw = Covariance between the wind components u and w

        - var_v = variance of v (horizontal wind component for the direction rectangular to the orientation of the sonic
