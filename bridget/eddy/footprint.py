"""
The `footprint` submodule implements common methods to calculate the
footprint of the measurement from Eddy Covariance data.

Beside several methods that can calculate the timevariat footprint,
an aggregation method for defining a common footprint region is
given.

Examples
--------

.. note::

    More to come soon

    ### calculations above could be "outsourced" into stand-alone functions, which are called in the footrpint function
    ### as these are pretty basic meteorological functions which could may be used in other bridget functions
